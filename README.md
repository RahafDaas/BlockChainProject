# Apartment Rental Project
This project aims to create a system that displays the available apartments to be rented.
We started by assuming that the structure of an apartment consists of:
* Name string
* Street Name string
* District Name string 
* Size int
* Rental Price float64
* Color string
* Rented string
  
Initially, an Apartment is not Rented therefore, the Rented field will always be "Not Rented" unless the RentApartment method from the Handler is called and assuming that the user paid the rent price. 

The functions of this system are:
* Updating the Name of an apartment.
* Updating the Street Name of an apartment.
* Updating the District Name of an apartment.
* Updating the Size of an apartment.
* Updating the Rental Price of an apartment.
* Updating the Color of an apartment Apartment Rental Project.
* Register an apartment.
* And to rent an apartment.
