This project aims to create a system that displays the available apartments to be rented.
We started by assuming that the structure of an apartment consists of:

- ID string
- Name string
- NumberOfRooms int
- Size int
- RentalPrice float64
- Kitchen bool
- LivingRoom bool
- RestroomNumber int
- FloorNumber int
- BuildYear int
- Location string
- WiFi bool
- Rented bool

The motivation behind this system is to have one place that links all apartments into one office to make renting apartments much easier and more flexible. Most of the required information regarding renting an apartment is available in this system. Initially, an apartment is not rented therefore, the Rented field will always be False unless the RentApartment method from the Handler is called and assuming that the user has paid the rent price. If the rent contract expires by calling the UnRentApartment method, the Rented field will switch to False.

The functions of this system are:

- Updating the Name of an apartment.
- Updating the Number of rooms in an apartment.
- Updating the Kitchen Availability of an apartment.
- Updating the Size of an apartment.
- Updating the Rental Price of an apartment.
- Updating the WiFi Availability of an apartment.
- Updating the availability of living room in an apartment.
- Updating the Restroom number of an apartment.
- Updating the Floor number of an apartment.
- Updating the Build year of an apartment.
- Updating the Location of an apartment.
- Register an apartment.
- To Rent an apartment.
- And to unrent an apartment.
